# FinCafé

Web application built with Next.js and React to administer coffee farms.

## 🚀 Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 📌 First deliverable

This initial iteration establishes the visual foundation of the project, introduces the three primary system roles, and ships with an English-first experience that can be translated into additional languages via the built-in language switcher.

- **Administrator** – oversees operations and coordinates system configuration.
- **Owner** – focuses on strategic vision and financial performance.
- **Employee** – executes daily tasks and reports incidents.

Upcoming iterations will add authentication, operational dashboards, and workflows tailored to each profile.
